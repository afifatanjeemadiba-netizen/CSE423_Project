Escape The Grid: 3D Adventure Game: 

Escape the Grid is an advanced 3D OpenGL game developed with PyOpenGL. 

The project demonstrates extensive use of 3D transformations (translation, rotation, scaling), perspective projection, 
and camera manipulation while providing a much richer and more interactive gameplay experience.
The player begins at the center of a dynamic 3D arena made of checkerboard tiles, some of which rise, fall, or turn into traps. 
The goal is to survive waves of enemies, collect diamonds and power-ups, and eventually escape the arena by defeating a boss enemy or gathering enough resources.

Gameplay Features:
1. Player

2. Enemies
•	Chasers: Classic red-sphere enemies that pursue the player.
•	Shooters: Stationary enemies that fire projectiles at the player.
•	Boss: A giant pulsating enemy that spawns after every 20 points, requiring multiple hits to defeat.

3. Arena
•	Dynamic checkerboard floor with moving platforms and lava trap tiles.

5. Environmental Effects: 
  -Dynamic Grid (Tile color, Tile Height): 
   Lava tiles pulse in color and height for a dynamic look. Obstacles (walls) have animated heights for visual effect. 
   High walls surround the arena to keep the player and enemies inside. The camera can switch to a top-down "map view" showing the entire 
   arena and its features.
  -Environment Hazards(Obstacle):
   Lava tiles deal damage to the player if they stand on them. Collect crystals to achieve more points. Achieve random power by collecting power points.
