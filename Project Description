Escape The Grid: 3D Adventure Game: 

Escape the Grid is an advanced 3D OpenGL game developed with PyOpenGL. 

The project demonstrates extensive use of 3D transformations (translation, rotation, scaling), perspective projection, 
and camera manipulation while providing a much richer and more interactive gameplay experience.
The player begins at the center of a dynamic 3D arena made of checkerboard tiles, some of which rise, fall, or turn into traps. 
The goal is to survive waves of enemies, collect diamonds and power-ups, and eventually escape the arena by defeating a boss enemy or gathering enough resources.
